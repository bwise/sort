It	2
is	2
a	1
melancholy	10
object	6
to	2
those,	6
who	3
walk	4
through	7
this	4
great	5
town,	5
or	2
travel	6
in	2
the	3
country,	8
when	4
they	4
see	3
the	3
streets,	8
the	3
roads	5
and	3
cabbin-doors	12
crowded	7
with	4
beggars	7
of	2
the	3
female	6
sex,	4
followed	8
by	2
three,	6
four,	5
or	2
six	3
children,	9
all	3
in	2
rags,	5
and	3
importuning	11
every	5
passenger	9
for	3
an	2
alms.	5
These	5
mothers	7
instead	7
of	2
being	5
able	4
to	2
work	4
for	3
their	5
honest	6
livelihood,	11
are	3
forced	6
to	2
employ	6
all	3
their	5
time	4
in	2
stroling	8
to	2
beg	3
sustenance	10
for	3
their	5
helpless	8
infants	7
who,	4
as	2
they	4
grow	4
up,	3
either	6
turn	4
thieves	7
for	3
want	4
of	2
work,	5
or	2
leave	5
their	5
dear	4
native	6
country,	8
to	2
fight	5
for	3
the	3
Pretender	9
in	2
Spain,	6
or	2
sell	4
themselves	10
to	2
the	3
Barbadoes.	10
I	1
think	5
it	2
is	2
agreed	6
by	2
all	3
parties,	8
that	4
this	4
prodigious	10
number	6
of	2
children	8
in	2
the	3
arms,	5
or	2
on	2
the	3
backs,	6
or	2
at	2
the	3
heels	5
of	2
their	5
mothers,	8
and	3
frequently	10
of	2
their	5
fathers,	8
is	2
in	2
the	3
present	7
deplorable	10
state	5
of	2
the	3
kingdom,	8
a	1
very	4
great	5
additional	10
grievance;	10
and	3
therefore	9
whoever	7
could	5
find	4
out	3
a	1
fair,	5
cheap	5
and	3
easy	4
method	6
of	2
making	6
these	5
children	8
sound	5
and	3
useful	6
members	7
of	2
the	3
common-wealth,	14
would	5
deserve	7
so	2
well	4
of	2
the	3
publick,	8
as	2
to	2
have	4
his	3
statue	6
set	3
up	2
for	3
a	1
preserver	9
of	2
the	3
nation.	7
But	3
my	2
intention	9
is	2
very	4
far	3
from	4
being	5
confined	8
to	2
provide	7
only	4
for	3
the	3
children	8
of	2
professed	9
beggars:	8
it	2
is	2
of	2
a	1
much	4
greater	7
extent,	7
and	3
shall	5
take	4
in	2
the	3
whole	5
number	6
of	2
infants	7
at	2
a	1
certain	7
age,	4
who	3
are	3
born	4
of	2
parents	7
in	2
effect	6
as	2
little	6
able	4
to	2
support	7
them,	5
as	2
those	5
who	3
demand	6
our	3
charity	7
in	2
the	3
streets.	8
As	2
to	2
my	2
own	3
part,	5
having	6
turned	6
my	2
thoughts	8
for	3
many	4
years,	6
upon	4
this	4
important	9
subject,	8
and	3
maturely	8
weighed	7
the	3
several	7
schemes	7
of	2
our	3
projectors,	11
I	1
have	4
always	6
found	5
them	4
grossly	7
mistaken	8
in	2
their	5
computation.	12
It	2
is	2
true,	5
a	1
child	5
just	4
dropt	5
from	4
its	3
dam,	4
may	3
be	2
supported	9
by	2
her	3
milk,	5
for	3
a	1
solar	5
year,	5
with	4
little	6
other	5
nourishment:	12
at	2
most	4
not	3
above	5
the	3
value	5
of	2
two	3
shillings,	10
which	5
the	3
mother	6
may	3
certainly	9
get,	4
or	2
the	3
value	5
in	2
scraps,	7
by	2
her	3
lawful	6
occupation	10
of	2
begging;	8
and	3
it	2
is	2
exactly	7
at	2
one	3
year	4
old	3
that	4
I	1
propose	7
to	2
provide	7
for	3
them	4
in	2
such	4
a	1
manner,	7
as,	3
instead	7
of	2
being	5
a	1
charge	6
upon	4
their	5
parents,	8
or	2
the	3
parish,	7
or	2
wanting	7
food	4
and	3
raiment	7
for	3
the	3
rest	4
of	2
their	5
lives,	6
they	4
shall,	6
on	2
the	3
contrary,	9
contribute	10
to	2
the	3
feeding,	8
and	3
partly	6
to	2
the	3
cloathing	9
of	2
many	4
thousands.	10
There	5
is	2
likewise	8
another	7
great	5
advantage	9
in	2
my	2
scheme,	7
that	4
it	2
will	4
prevent	7
those	5
voluntary	9
abortions,	10
and	3
that	4
horrid	6
practice	8
of	2
women	5
murdering	9
their	5
bastard	7
children,	9
alas!	5
too	3
frequent	8
among	5
us,	3
sacrificing	11
the	3
poor	4
innocent	8
babes,	6
I	1
doubt,	6
more	4
to	2
avoid	5
the	3
expence	7
than	4
the	3
shame,	6
which	5
would	5
move	4
tears	5
and	3
pity	4
in	2
the	3
most	4
savage	6
and	3
inhuman	7
breast.	7
The	3
number	6
of	2
souls	5
in	2
this	4
kingdom	7
being	5
usually	7
reckoned	8
one	3
million	7
and	3
a	1
half,	5
of	2
these	5
I	1
calculate	9
there	5
may	3
be	2
about	5
two	3
hundred	7
thousand	8
couple	6
whose	5
wives	5
are	3
breeders;	9
from	4
which	5
number	6
I	1
subtract	8
thirty	6
thousand	8
couple,	7
who	3
are	3
able	4
to	2
maintain	8
their	5
own	3
children,	9
(although	9
I	1
apprehend	9
there	5
cannot	6
be	2
so	2
many,	5
under	5
the	3
present	7
distresses	10
of	2
the	3
kingdom)	8
but	3
this	4
being	5
granted,	8
there	5
will	4
remain	6
an	2
hundred	7
and	3
seventy	7
thousand	8
breeders.	9
I	1
again	5
subtract	8
fifty	5
thousand,	9
for	3
those	5
women	5
who	3
miscarry,	9
or	2
whose	5
children	8
die	3
by	2
accident	8
or	2
disease	7
within	6
the	3
year.	5
There	5
only	4
remain	6
an	2
hundred	7
and	3
twenty	6
thousand	8
children	8
of	2
poor	4
parents	7
annually	8
born.	5
The	3
question	8
therefore	9
is,	3
How	3
this	4
number	6
shall	5
be	2
reared,	7
and	3
provided	8
for?	4
which,	6
as	2
I	1
have	4
already	7
said,	5
under	5
the	3
present	7
situation	9
of	2
affairs,	8
is	2
utterly	7
impossible	10
by	2
all	3
the	3
methods	7
hitherto	8
proposed.	9
For	3
we	2
can	3
neither	7
employ	6
them	4
in	2
handicraft	10
or	2
agriculture;	12
we	2
neither	7
build	5
houses,	7
(I	2
mean	4
in	2
the	3
country)	8
nor	3
cultivate	9
land:	5
they	4
can	3
very	4
seldom	6
pick	4
up	2
a	1
livelihood	10
by	2
stealing	8
till	4
they	4
arrive	6
at	2
six	3
years	5
old;	4
except	6
where	5
they	4
are	3
of	2
towardly	8
parts,	6
although	8
I	1
confess	7
they	4
learn	5
the	3
rudiments	9
much	4
earlier;	8
during	6
which	5
time	4
they	4
can	3
however	7
be	2
properly	8
looked	6
upon	4
only	4
as	2
probationers:	13
As	2
I	1
have	4
been	4
informed	8
by	2
a	1
principal	9
gentleman	9
in	2
the	3
county	6
of	2
Cavan,	6
who	3
protested	9
to	2
me,	3
that	4
he	2
never	5
knew	4
above	5
one	3
or	2
two	3
instances	9
under	5
the	3
age	3
of	2
six,	4
even	4
in	2
a	1
part	4
of	2
the	3
kingdom	7
so	2
renowned	8
for	3
the	3
quickest	8
proficiency	11
in	2
that	4
art.	4
I	1
am	2
assured	7
by	2
our	3
merchants,	10
that	4
a	1
boy	3
or	2
a	1
girl	4
before	6
twelve	6
years	5
old,	4
is	2
no	2
saleable	8
commodity,	10
and	3
even	4
when	4
they	4
come	4
to	2
this	4
age,	4
they	4
will	4
not	3
yield	5
above	5
three	5
pounds,	7
or	2
three	5
pounds	6
and	3
half	4
a	1
crown	5
at	2
most,	5
on	2
the	3
exchange;	9
which	5
cannot	6
turn	4
to	2
account	7
either	6
to	2
the	3
parents	7
or	2
kingdom,	8
the	3
charge	6
of	2
nutriments	10
and	3
rags	4
having	6
been	4
at	2
least	5
four	4
times	5
that	4
value.	6
I	1
shall	5
now	3
therefore	9
humbly	6
propose	7
my	2
own	3
thoughts,	9
which	5
I	1
hope	4
will	4
not	3
be	2
liable	6
to	2
the	3
least	5
objection.	10
I	1
have	4
been	4
assured	7
by	2
a	1
very	4
knowing	7
American	8
of	2
my	2
acquaintance	12
in	2
London,	7
that	4
a	1
young	5
healthy	7
child	5
well	4
nursed,	7
is,	3
at	2
a	1
year	4
old,	4
a	1
most	4
delicious	9
nourishing	10
and	3
wholesome	9
food,	5
whether	7
stewed,	7
roasted,	8
baked,	6
or	2
boiled;	7
and	3
I	1
make	4
no	2
doubt	5
that	4
it	2
will	4
equally	7
serve	5
in	2
a	1
fricasie,	9
or	2
a	1
ragoust.	8
I	1
do	2
therefore	9
humbly	6
offer	5
it	2
to	2
publick	7
consideration,	14
that	4
of	2
the	3
hundred	7
and	3
twenty	6
thousand	8
children,	9
already	7
computed,	9
twenty	6
thousand	8
may	3
be	2
reserved	8
for	3
breed,	6
whereof	7
only	4
one	3
fourth	6
part	4
to	2
be	2
males;	6
which	5
is	2
more	4
than	4
we	2
allow	5
to	2
sheep,	6
black	5
cattle,	7
or	2
swine,	6
and	3
my	2
reason	6
is,	3
that	4
these	5
children	8
are	3
seldom	6
the	3
fruits	6
of	2
marriage,	9
a	1
circumstance	12
not	3
much	4
regarded	8
by	2
our	3
savages,	8
therefore,	10
one	3
male	4
will	4
be	2
sufficient	10
to	2
serve	5
four	4
females.	8
That	4
the	3
remaining	9
hundred	7
thousand	8
may,	4
at	2
a	1
year	4
old,	4
be	2
offered	7
in	2
sale	4
to	2
the	3
persons	7
of	2
quality	7
and	3
fortune,	8
through	7
the	3
kingdom,	8
always	6
advising	8
the	3
mother	6
to	2
let	3
them	4
suck	4
plentifully	11
in	2
the	3
last	4
month,	6
so	2
as	2
to	2
render	6
them	4
plump,	6
and	3
fat	3
for	3
a	1
good	4
table.	6
A	1
child	5
will	4
make	4
two	3
dishes	6
at	2
an	2
entertainment	13
for	3
friends,	8
and	3
when	4
the	3
family	6
dines	5
alone,	6
the	3
fore	4
or	2
hind	4
quarter	7
will	4
make	4
a	1
reasonable	10
dish,	5
and	3
seasoned	8
with	4
a	1
little	6
pepper	6
or	2
salt,	5
will	4
be	2
very	4
good	4
boiled	6
on	2
the	3
fourth	6
day,	4
especially	10
in	2
winter.	7
I	1
have	4
reckoned	8
upon	4
a	1
medium,	7
that	4
a	1
child	5
just	4
born	4
will	4
weigh	5
12	2
pounds,	7
and	3
in	2
a	1
solar	5
year,	5
if	2
tolerably	9
nursed,	7
encreaseth	10
to	2
28	2
pounds.	7
I	1
grant	5
this	4
food	4
will	4
be	2
somewhat	8
dear,	5
and	3
therefore	9
very	4
proper	6
for	3
landlords,	10
who,	4
as	2
they	4
have	4
already	7
devoured	8
most	4
of	2
the	3
parents,	8
seem	4
to	2
have	4
the	3
best	4
title	5
to	2
the	3
children.	9
Infant's	8
flesh	5
will	4
be	2
in	2
season	6
throughout	10
the	3
year,	5
but	3
more	4
plentiful	9
in	2
March,	6
and	3
a	1
little	6
before	6
and	3
after;	6
for	3
we	2
are	3
told	4
by	2
a	1
grave	5
author,	7
an	2
eminent	7
French	6
physician,	10
that	4
fish	4
being	5
a	1
prolifick	9
dyet,	5
there	5
are	3
more	4
children	8
born	4
in	2
Roman	5
Catholick	9
countries	9
about	5
nine	4
months	6
after	5
Lent,	5
the	3
markets	7
will	4
be	2
more	4
glutted	7
than	4
usual,	6
because	7
the	3
number	6
of	2
Popish	6
infants,	8
is	2
at	2
least	5
three	5
to	2
one	3
in	2
this	4
kingdom,	8
and	3
therefore	9
it	2
will	4
have	4
one	3
other	5
collateral	10
advantage,	10
by	2
lessening	9
the	3
number	6
of	2
Papists	7
among	5
us.	3
I	1
have	4
already	7
computed	8
the	3
charge	6
of	2
nursing	7
a	1
beggar's	8
child	5
(in	3
which	5
list	4
I	1
reckon	6
all	3
cottagers,	10
labourers,	10
and	3
four-fifths	11
of	2
the	3
farmers)	8
to	2
be	2
about	5
two	3
shillings	9
per	3
annum,	6
rags	4
included;	9
and	3
I	1
believe	7
no	2
gentleman	9
would	5
repine	6
to	2
give	4
ten	3
shillings	9
for	3
the	3
carcass	7
of	2
a	1
good	4
fat	3
child,	6
which,	6
as	2
I	1
have	4
said,	5
will	4
make	4
four	4
dishes	6
of	2
excellent	9
nutritive	9
meat,	5
when	4
he	2
hath	4
only	4
some	4
particular	10
friend,	7
or	2
his	3
own	3
family	6
to	2
dine	4
with	4
him.	4
Thus	4
the	3
squire	6
will	4
learn	5
to	2
be	2
a	1
good	4
landlord,	9
and	3
grow	4
popular	7
among	5
his	3
tenants,	8
the	3
mother	6
will	4
have	4
eight	5
shillings	9
neat	4
profit,	7
and	3
be	2
fit	3
for	3
work	4
till	4
she	3
produces	8
another	7
child.	6
Those	5
who	3
are	3
more	4
thrifty	7
(as	3
I	1
must	4
confess	7
the	3
times	5
require)	8
may	3
flea	4
the	3
carcass;	8
the	3
skin	4
of	2
which,	6
artificially	12
dressed,	8
will	4
make	4
admirable	9
gloves	6
for	3
ladies,	7
and	3
summer	6
boots	5
for	3
fine	4
gentlemen.	10
As	2
to	2
our	3
City	4
of	2
Dublin,	7
shambles	8
may	3
be	2
appointed	9
for	3
this	4
purpose,	8
in	2
the	3
most	4
convenient	10
parts	5
of	2
it,	3
and	3
butchers	8
we	2
may	3
be	2
assured	7
will	4
not	3
be	2
wanting;	8
although	8
I	1
rather	6
recommend	9
buying	6
the	3
children	8
alive,	6
and	3
dressing	8
them	4
hot	3
from	4
the	3
knife,	6
as	2
we	2
do	2
roasting	8
pigs.	5
A	1
very	4
worthy	6
person,	7
a	1
true	4
lover	5
of	2
his	3
country,	8
and	3
whose	5
virtues	7
I	1
highly	6
esteem,	7
was	3
lately	6
pleased,	8
in	2
discoursing	11
on	2
this	4
matter,	7
to	2
offer	5
a	1
refinement	10
upon	4
my	2
scheme.	7
He	2
said,	5
that	4
many	4
gentlemen	9
of	2
this	4
kingdom,	8
having	6
of	2
late	4
destroyed	9
their	5
deer,	5
he	2
conceived	9
that	4
the	3
want	4
of	2
venison	7
might	5
be	2
well	4
supply'd	8
by	2
the	3
bodies	6
of	2
young	5
lads	4
and	3
maidens,	8
not	3
exceeding	9
fourteen	8
years	5
of	2
age,	4
nor	3
under	5
twelve;	7
so	2
great	5
a	1
number	6
of	2
both	4
sexes	5
in	2
every	5
country	7
being	5
now	3
ready	5
to	2
starve	6
for	3
want	4
of	2
work	4
and	3
service:	8
And	3
these	5
to	2
be	2
disposed	8
of	2
by	2
their	5
parents	7
if	2
alive,	6
or	2
otherwise	9
by	2
their	5
nearest	7
relations.	10
But	3
with	4
due	3
deference	9
to	2
so	2
excellent	9
a	1
friend,	7
and	3
so	2
deserving	9
a	1
patriot,	8
I	1
cannot	6
be	2
altogether	10
in	2
his	3
sentiments;	11
for	3
as	2
to	2
the	3
males,	6
my	2
American	8
acquaintance	12
assured	7
me	2
from	4
frequent	8
experience,	11
that	4
their	5
flesh	5
was	3
generally	9
tough	5
and	3
lean,	5
like	4
that	4
of	2
our	3
school-boys,	12
by	2
continual	9
exercise,	9
and	3
their	5
taste	5
disagreeable,	13
and	3
to	2
fatten	6
them	4
would	5
not	3
answer	6
the	3
charge.	7
Then	4
as	2
to	2
the	3
females,	8
it	2
would,	6
I	1
think,	6
with	4
humble	6
submission,	11
be	2
a	1
loss	4
to	2
the	3
publick,	8
because	7
they	4
soon	4
would	5
become	6
breeders	8
themselves:	11
And	3
besides,	8
it	2
is	2
not	3
improbable	10
that	4
some	4
scrupulous	10
people	6
might	5
be	2
apt	3
to	2
censure	7
such	4
a	1
practice,	9
(although	9
indeed	6
very	4
unjustly)	9
as	2
a	1
little	6
bordering	9
upon	4
cruelty,	8
which,	6
I	1
confess,	8
hath	4
always	6
been	4
with	4
me	2
the	3
strongest	9
objection	9
against	7
any	3
project,	8
how	3
well	4
soever	6
intended.	9
But	3
in	2
order	5
to	2
justify	7
my	2
friend,	7
he	2
confessed,	10
that	4
this	4
expedient	9
was	3
put	3
into	4
his	3
head	4
by	2
the	3
famous	6
Salmanaazor,	12
a	1
native	6
of	2
the	3
island	6
Formosa,	8
who	3
came	4
from	4
thence	6
to	2
London,	7
above	5
twenty	6
years	5
ago,	4
and	3
in	2
conversation	12
told	4
my	2
friend,	7
that	4
in	2
his	3
country,	8
when	4
any	3
young	5
person	6
happened	8
to	2
be	2
put	3
to	2
death,	6
the	3
executioner	11
sold	4
the	3
carcass	7
to	2
persons	7
of	2
quality,	8
as	2
a	1
prime	5
dainty;	7
and	3
that,	5
in	2
his	3
time,	5
the	3
body	4
of	2
a	1
plump	5
girl	4
of	2
fifteen,	8
who	3
was	3
crucified	9
for	3
an	2
attempt	7
to	2
poison	6
the	3
Emperor,	8
was	3
sold	4
to	2
his	3
imperial	8
majesty's	9
prime	5
minister	8
of	2
state,	6
and	3
other	5
great	5
mandarins	9
of	2
the	3
court	5
in	2
joints	6
from	4
the	3
gibbet,	7
at	2
four	4
hundred	7
crowns.	7
Neither	7
indeed	6
can	3
I	1
deny,	5
that	4
if	2
the	3
same	4
use	3
were	4
made	4
of	2
several	7
plump	5
young	5
girls	5
in	2
this	4
town,	5
who	3
without	7
one	3
single	6
groat	5
to	2
their	5
fortunes,	9
cannot	6
stir	4
abroad	6
without	7
a	1
chair,	6
and	3
appear	6
at	2
a	1
play-house	10
and	3
assemblies	10
in	2
foreign	7
fineries	8
which	5
they	4
never	5
will	4
pay	3
for;	4
the	3
kingdom	7
would	5
not	3
be	2
the	3
worse.	6
Some	4
persons	7
of	2
a	1
desponding	10
spirit	6
are	3
in	2
great	5
concern	7
about	5
that	4
vast	4
number	6
of	2
poor	4
people,	7
who	3
are	3
aged,	5
diseased,	9
or	2
maimed;	7
and	3
I	1
have	4
been	4
desired	7
to	2
employ	6
my	2
thoughts	8
what	4
course	6
may	3
be	2
taken,	6
to	2
ease	4
the	3
nation	6
of	2
so	2
grievous	8
an	2
incumbrance.	12
But	3
I	1
am	2
not	3
in	2
the	3
least	5
pain	4
upon	4
that	4
matter,	7
because	7
it	2
is	2
very	4
well	4
known,	6
that	4
they	4
are	3
every	5
day	3
dying,	6
and	3
rotting,	8
by	2
cold	4
and	3
famine,	7
and	3
filth,	6
and	3
vermin,	7
as	2
fast	4
as	2
can	3
be	2
reasonably	10
expected.	9
And	3
as	2
to	2
the	3
young	5
labourers,	10
they	4
are	3
now	3
in	2
almost	6
as	2
hopeful	7
a	1
condition.	10
They	4
cannot	6
get	3
work,	5
and	3
consequently	12
pine	4
away	4
from	4
want	4
of	2
nourishment,	12
to	2
a	1
degree,	7
that	4
if	2
at	2
any	3
time	4
they	4
are	3
accidentally	12
hired	5
to	2
common	6
labour,	7
they	4
have	4
not	3
strength	8
to	2
perform	7
it,	3
and	3
thus	4
the	3
country	7
and	3
themselves	10
are	3
happily	7
delivered	9
from	4
the	3
evils	5
to	2
come.	5
I	1
have	4
too	3
long	4
digressed,	10
and	3
therefore	9
shall	5
return	6
to	2
my	2
subject.	8
I	1
think	5
the	3
advantages	10
by	2
the	3
proposal	8
which	5
I	1
have	4
made	4
are	3
obvious	7
and	3
many,	5
as	2
well	4
as	2
of	2
the	3
highest	7
importance.	11
For	3
first,	6
as	2
I	1
have	4
already	7
observed,	9
it	2
would	5
greatly	7
lessen	6
the	3
number	6
of	2
Papists,	8
with	4
whom	4
we	2
are	3
yearly	6
over-run,	9
being	5
the	3
principal	9
breeders	8
of	2
the	3
nation,	7
as	2
well	4
as	2
our	3
most	4
dangerous	9
enemies,	8
and	3
who	3
stay	4
at	2
home	4
on	2
purpose	7
with	4
a	1
design	6
to	2
deliver	7
the	3
kingdom	7
to	2
the	3
Pretender,	10
hoping	6
to	2
take	4
their	5
advantage	9
by	2
the	3
absence	7
of	2
so	2
many	4
good	4
Protestants,	12
who	3
have	4
chosen	6
rather	6
to	2
leave	5
their	5
country,	8
than	4
stay	4
at	2
home	4
and	3
pay	3
tithes	6
against	7
their	5
conscience	10
to	2
an	2
episcopal	9
curate.	7
Secondly,	9
The	3
poorer	6
tenants	7
will	4
have	4
something	9
valuable	8
of	2
their	5
own,	4
which	5
by	2
law	3
may	3
be	2
made	4
liable	6
to	2
a	1
distress,	9
and	3
help	4
to	2
pay	3
their	5
landlord's	10
rent,	5
their	5
corn	4
and	3
cattle	6
being	5
already	7
seized,	7
and	3
money	5
a	1
thing	5
unknown.	8
Thirdly,	8
Whereas	7
the	3
maintainance	12
of	2
an	2
hundred	7
thousand	8
children,	9
from	4
two	3
years	5
old,	4
and	3
upwards,	8
cannot	6
be	2
computed	8
at	2
less	4
than	4
ten	3
shillings	9
a	1
piece	5
per	3
annum,	6
the	3
nation's	8
stock	5
will	4
be	2
thereby	7
encreased	9
fifty	5
thousand	8
pounds	6
per	3
annum,	6
besides	7
the	3
profit	6
of	2
a	1
new	3
dish,	5
introduced	10
to	2
the	3
tables	6
of	2
all	3
gentlemen	9
of	2
fortune	7
in	2
the	3
kingdom,	8
who	3
have	4
any	3
refinement	10
in	2
taste.	6
And	3
the	3
money	5
will	4
circulate	9
among	5
our	3
selves,	7
the	3
goods	5
being	5
entirely	8
of	2
our	3
own	3
growth	6
and	3
manufacture.	12
Fourthly,	9
The	3
constant	8
breeders,	9
besides	7
the	3
gain	4
of	2
eight	5
shillings	9
sterling	8
per	3
annum	5
by	2
the	3
sale	4
of	2
their	5
children,	9
will	4
be	2
rid	3
of	2
the	3
charge	6
of	2
maintaining	11
them	4
after	5
the	3
first	5
year.	5
Fifthly,	8
This	4
food	4
would	5
likewise	8
bring	5
great	5
custom	6
to	2
taverns,	8
where	5
the	3
vintners	8
will	4
certainly	9
be	2
so	2
prudent	7
as	2
to	2
procure	7
the	3
best	4
receipts	8
for	3
dressing	8
it	2
to	2
perfection;	11
and	3
consequently	12
have	4
their	5
houses	6
frequented	10
by	2
all	3
the	3
fine	4
gentlemen,	10
who	3
justly	6
value	5
themselves	10
upon	4
their	5
knowledge	9
in	2
good	4
eating;	7
and	3
a	1
skilful	7
cook,	5
who	3
understands	11
how	3
to	2
oblige	6
his	3
guests,	7
will	4
contrive	8
to	2
make	4
it	2
as	2
expensive	9
as	2
they	4
please.	7
Sixthly,	8
This	4
would	5
be	2
a	1
great	5
inducement	10
to	2
marriage,	9
which	5
all	3
wise	4
nations	7
have	4
either	6
encouraged	10
by	2
rewards,	8
or	2
enforced	8
by	2
laws	4
and	3
penalties.	10
It	2
would	5
encrease	8
the	3
care	4
and	3
tenderness	10
of	2
mothers	7
towards	7
their	5
children,	9
when	4
they	4
were	4
sure	4
of	2
a	1
settlement	10
for	3
life	4
to	2
the	3
poor	4
babes,	6
provided	8
in	2
some	4
sort	4
by	2
the	3
publick,	8
to	2
their	5
annual	6
profit	6
instead	7
of	2
expence.	8
We	2
should	6
soon	4
see	3
an	2
honest	6
emulation	9
among	5
the	3
married	7
women,	6
which	5
of	2
them	4
could	5
bring	5
the	3
fattest	7
child	5
to	2
the	3
market.	7
Men	3
would	5
become	6
as	2
fond	4
of	2
their	5
wives,	6
during	6
the	3
time	4
of	2
their	5
pregnancy,	10
as	2
they	4
are	3
now	3
of	2
their	5
mares	5
in	2
foal,	5
their	5
cows	4
in	2
calf,	5
or	2
sow	3
when	4
they	4
are	3
ready	5
to	2
farrow;	7
nor	3
offer	5
to	2
beat	4
or	2
kick	4
them	4
(as	3
is	2
too	3
frequent	8
a	1
practice)	9
for	3
fear	4
of	2
a	1
miscarriage.	12
Many	4
other	5
advantages	10
might	5
be	2
enumerated.	11
For	3
instance,	9
the	3
addition	8
of	2
some	4
thousand	8
carcasses	9
in	2
our	3
exportation	11
of	2
barrel'd	8
beef:	5
the	3
propagation	11
of	2
swine's	7
flesh,	6
and	3
improvement	11
in	2
the	3
art	3
of	2
making	6
good	4
bacon,	6
so	2
much	4
wanted	6
among	5
us	2
by	2
the	3
great	5
destruction	11
of	2
pigs,	5
too	3
frequent	8
at	2
our	3
tables;	7
which	5
are	3
no	2
way	3
comparable	10
in	2
taste	5
or	2
magnificence	12
to	2
a	1
well	4
grown,	6
fat	3
yearly	6
child,	6
which	5
roasted	7
whole	5
will	4
make	4
a	1
considerable	12
figure	6
at	2
a	1
Lord	4
Mayor's	7
feast,	6
or	2
any	3
other	5
publick	7
entertainment.	14
But	3
this,	5
and	3
many	4
others,	7
I	1
omit,	5
being	5
studious	8
of	2
brevity.	8
Supposing	9
that	4
one	3
thousand	8
families	8
in	2
this	4
city,	5
would	5
be	2
constant	8
customers	9
for	3
infants	7
flesh,	6
besides	7
others	6
who	3
might	5
have	4
it	2
at	2
merry	5
meetings,	9
particularly	12
at	2
weddings	8
and	3
christenings,	13
I	1
compute	7
that	4
Dublin	6
would	5
take	4
off	3
annually	8
about	5
twenty	6
thousand	8
carcasses;	10
and	3
the	3
rest	4
of	2
the	3
kingdom	7
(where	6
probably	8
they	4
will	4
be	2
sold	4
somewhat	8
cheaper)	8
the	3
remaining	9
eighty	6
thousand.	9
I	1
can	3
think	5
of	2
no	2
one	3
objection,	10
that	4
will	4
possibly	8
be	2
raised	6
against	7
this	4
proposal,	9
unless	6
it	2
should	6
be	2
urged,	6
that	4
the	3
number	6
of	2
people	6
will	4
be	2
thereby	7
much	4
lessened	8
in	2
the	3
kingdom.	8
This	4
I	1
freely	6
own,	4
and	3
'twas	5
indeed	6
one	3
principal	9
design	6
in	2
offering	8
it	2
to	2
the	3
world.	6
I	1
desire	6
the	3
reader	6
will	4
observe,	8
that	4
I	1
calculate	9
my	2
remedy	6
for	3
this	4
one	3
individual	10
Kingdom	7
of	2
Ireland,	8
and	3
for	3
no	2
other	5
that	4
ever	4
was,	4
is,	3
or,	3
I	1
think,	6
ever	4
can	3
be	2
upon	4
Earth.	6
Therefore	9
let	3
no	2
man	3
talk	4
to	2
me	2
of	2
other	5
expedients:	11
Of	2
taxing	6
our	3
absentees	9
at	2
five	4
shillings	9
a	1
pound:	6
Of	2
using	5
neither	7
cloaths,	8
nor	3
houshold	8
furniture,	10
except	6
what	4
is	2
of	2
our	3
own	3
growth	6
and	3
manufacture:	12
Of	2
utterly	7
rejecting	9
the	3
materials	9
and	3
instruments	11
that	4
promote	7
foreign	7
luxury:	7
Of	2
curing	6
the	3
expensiveness	13
of	2
pride,	6
vanity,	7
idleness,	9
and	3
gaming	6
in	2
our	3
women:	6
Of	2
introducing	11
a	1
vein	4
of	2
parsimony,	10
prudence	8
and	3
temperance:	11
Of	2
learning	8
to	2
love	4
our	3
country,	8
wherein	7
we	2
differ	6
even	4
from	4
Laplanders,	11
and	3
the	3
inhabitants	11
of	2
Topinamboo:	11
Of	2
quitting	8
our	3
animosities	11
and	3
factions,	9
nor	3
acting	6
any	3
longer	6
like	4
the	3
Jews,	5
who	3
were	4
murdering	9
one	3
another	7
at	2
the	3
very	4
moment	6
their	5
city	4
was	3
taken:	6
Of	2
being	5
a	1
little	6
cautious	8
not	3
to	2
sell	4
our	3
country	7
and	3
consciences	11
for	3
nothing:	8
Of	2
teaching	8
landlords	9
to	2
have	4
at	2
least	5
one	3
degree	6
of	2
mercy	5
towards	7
their	5
tenants.	8
Lastly,	7
of	2
putting	7
a	1
spirit	6
of	2
honesty,	8
industry,	9
and	3
skill	5
into	4
our	3
shop-keepers,	13
who,	4
if	2
a	1
resolution	10
could	5
now	3
be	2
taken	5
to	2
buy	3
only	4
our	3
native	6
goods,	6
would	5
immediately	11
unite	5
to	2
cheat	5
and	3
exact	5
upon	4
us	2
in	2
the	3
price,	6
the	3
measure,	8
and	3
the	3
goodness,	9
nor	3
could	5
ever	4
yet	3
be	2
brought	7
to	2
make	4
one	3
fair	4
proposal	8
of	2
just	4
dealing,	8
though	6
often	5
and	3
earnestly	9
invited	7
to	2
it.	3
Therefore	9
I	1
repeat,	7
let	3
no	2
man	3
talk	4
to	2
me	2
of	2
these	5
and	3
the	3
like	4
expedients,	11
'till	5
he	2
hath	4
at	2
least	5
some	4
glympse	7
of	2
hope,	5
that	4
there	5
will	4
ever	4
be	2
some	4
hearty	6
and	3
sincere	7
attempt	7
to	2
put	3
them	4
into	4
practice.	9
But,	4
as	2
to	2
my	2
self,	5
having	6
been	4
wearied	7
out	3
for	3
many	4
years	5
with	4
offering	8
vain,	5
idle,	5
visionary	9
thoughts,	9
and	3
at	2
length	6
utterly	7
despairing	10
of	2
success,	8
I	1
fortunately	11
fell	4
upon	4
this	4
proposal,	9
which,	6
as	2
it	2
is	2
wholly	6
new,	4
so	2
it	2
hath	4
something	9
solid	5
and	3
real,	5
of	2
no	2
expence	7
and	3
little	6
trouble,	8
full	4
in	2
our	3
own	3
power,	6
and	3
whereby	7
we	2
can	3
incur	5
no	2
danger	6
in	2
disobliging	11
England.	8
For	3
this	4
kind	4
of	2
commodity	9
will	4
not	3
bear	4
exportation,	12
and	3
flesh	5
being	5
of	2
too	3
tender	6
a	1
consistence,	12
to	2
admit	5
a	1
long	4
continuance	11
in	2
salt,	5
although	8
perhaps	7
I	1
could	5
name	4
a	1
country,	8
which	5
would	5
be	2
glad	4
to	2
eat	3
up	2
our	3
whole	5
nation	6
without	7
it.	3
After	5
all,	4
I	1
am	2
not	3
so	2
violently	9
bent	4
upon	4
my	2
own	3
opinion,	8
as	2
to	2
reject	6
any	3
offer,	6
proposed	8
by	2
wise	4
men,	4
which	5
shall	5
be	2
found	5
equally	7
innocent,	9
cheap,	6
easy,	5
and	3
effectual.	10
But	3
before	6
something	9
of	2
that	4
kind	4
shall	5
be	2
advanced	8
in	2
contradiction	13
to	2
my	2
scheme,	7
and	3
offering	8
a	1
better,	7
I	1
desire	6
the	3
author	6
or	2
authors	7
will	4
be	2
pleased	7
maturely	8
to	2
consider	8
two	3
points.	7
First,	6
As	2
things	6
now	3
stand,	6
how	3
they	4
will	4
be	2
able	4
to	2
find	4
food	4
and	3
raiment	7
for	3
a	1
hundred	7
thousand	8
useless	7
mouths	6
and	3
backs.	6
And	3
secondly,	9
There	5
being	5
a	1
round	5
million	7
of	2
creatures	9
in	2
humane	6
figure	6
throughout	10
this	4
kingdom,	8
whose	5
whole	5
subsistence	11
put	3
into	4
a	1
common	6
stock,	6
would	5
leave	5
them	4
in	2
debt	4
two	3
million	7
of	2
pounds	6
sterling,	9
adding	6
those	5
who	3
are	3
beggars	7
by	2
profession,	11
to	2
the	3
bulk	4
of	2
farmers,	8
cottagers	9
and	3
labourers,	10
with	4
their	5
wives	5
and	3
children,	9
who	3
are	3
beggars	7
in	2
effect;	7
I	1
desire	6
those	5
politicians	11
who	3
dislike	7
my	2
overture,	9
and	3
may	3
perhaps	7
be	2
so	2
bold	4
to	2
attempt	7
an	2
answer,	7
that	4
they	4
will	4
first	5
ask	3
the	3
parents	7
of	2
these	5
mortals,	8
whether	7
they	4
would	5
not	3
at	2
this	4
day	3
think	5
it	2
a	1
great	5
happiness	9
to	2
have	4
been	4
sold	4
for	3
food	4
at	2
a	1
year	4
old,	4
in	2
the	3
manner	6
I	1
prescribe,	10
and	3
thereby	7
have	4
avoided	7
such	4
a	1
perpetual	9
scene	5
of	2
misfortunes,	12
as	2
they	4
have	4
since	5
gone	4
through,	8
by	2
the	3
oppression	10
of	2
landlords,	10
the	3
impossibility	13
of	2
paying	6
rent	4
without	7
money	5
or	2
trade,	6
the	3
want	4
of	2
common	6
sustenance,	11
with	4
neither	7
house	5
nor	3
cloaths	7
to	2
cover	5
them	4
from	4
the	3
inclemencies	12
of	2
the	3
weather,	8
and	3
the	3
most	4
inevitable	10
prospect	8
of	2
intailing	9
the	3
like,	5
or	2
greater	7
miseries,	9
upon	4
their	5
breed	5
for	3
ever.	5
I	1
profess,	8
in	2
the	3
sincerity	9
of	2
my	2
heart,	6
that	4
I	1
have	4
not	3
the	3
least	5
personal	8
interest	8
in	2
endeavouring	12
to	2
promote	7
this	4
necessary	9
work,	5
having	6
no	2
other	5
motive	6
than	4
the	3
publick	7
good	4
of	2
my	2
country,	8
by	2
advancing	9
our	3
trade,	6
providing	9
for	3
infants,	8
relieving	9
the	3
poor,	5
and	3
giving	6
some	4
pleasure	8
to	2
the	3
rich.	5
I	1
have	4
no	2
children,	9
by	2
which	5
I	1
can	3
propose	7
to	2
get	3
a	1
single	6
penny;	6
the	3
youngest	8
being	5
nine	4
years	5
old,	4
and	3
my	2
wife	4
past	4
child-bearing.	14
